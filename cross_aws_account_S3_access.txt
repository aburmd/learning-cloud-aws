How to setup cross aws account S3 access:

1)	Set up made through Sourcing AWS Account:
•	Login to sourcing aws account (XXXXXXX2) and Create a bucket with an access "objects can be public".
•	Go to bucket, click on permission tab, click on bucket policy tab and apply below details
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DelegateS3Access",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXX1:root"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::source_bucket/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::source_bucket"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

•	Note: The above configuration is allowed account level access (XXXXXXX1).If we want at IAM role level access, add the respective arn there.

2)	Set up made through Target AWS Account
•	Login to target aws account (XXXXXXX1) and create a IAM user with S3 read/write access permission and create a access key and secret key.

3)	Setup AWS CLI Configuration
•	Install aws cli in your local desktop and add the credential with proper profile name (refer aws cli setup page for more info). Here, I have setup the profile name as 'target'.
•	Run the below command. This will sync these two folders 
aws s3 sync s3://source_bucket s3://target_bucket --delete --source-region us-west-2 --profile target
